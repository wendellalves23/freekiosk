## [Unreleased]

### Added
- 🎨 **Status bar light/dark theme** (#118): A new "Status Bar Theme" toggle (Light / Dark) is now available in Settings → Display → Status Bar. In Dark mode (default), the status bar renders with white icons on a dark background — suitable for kiosks with dark web content. In Light mode, icons are black on a transparent/light background — suitable for kiosks with white or bright web content. All icons (battery, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, volume, clock) are now rendered with `MaterialCommunityIcons` replacing the previous emoji characters, for consistent sizing, alignment, and color control across Android versions.

- 🎙️ **Voice selection for Web Speech API TTS polyfill** (#169): The `speechSynthesis.getVoices()` polyfill now returns the actual list of installed Android TTS voices instead of an empty array. Web apps that select a specific voice via `utterance.voice = voices.find(v => v.name === '...')` will have that voice applied natively. REST API: `POST /api/tts` now accepts an optional `voiceUri` parameter to select a voice by URI for a single speak call. The available voice list is pre-cached at startup for performance (`cacheTtsVoices()`) and refreshed on demand.

### Fixed
- 🔐 **SSL certificate dialog not shown for initial navigation and same-host redirects** (#144): The custom SSL certificate acceptance dialog (Settings → General → Accept Self-Signed Certificates) only appeared when the failing URL exactly matched the currently loaded page URL. This excluded two common cases: (1) **initial navigation** — when the app launches and loads the first page, there is no currently loaded URL, so the dialog was never shown; (2) **HTTP→HTTPS redirects** — a redirect from `http://host/` to `https://host/` produces the same host but a different URL, which the string equality check rejected. Fixed by replacing the URL equality check with a `isMainFrameRequest()` helper that matches on same-host (regardless of scheme or path), and treating a null/empty current URL as a main-frame request. Sub-resource SSL errors (images, fonts, iframes from third-party domains) are still silently denied to avoid flooding the user with dialogs.

- 📺 **MQTT/REST `screenOn` / `screenOff` commands did not physically lock the screen** (#155): `POST /api/screen/on` and `POST /api/screen/off` (and their MQTT equivalents) only activated or deactivated the screensaver overlay — they never called `lockNow()` to actually turn off the display. As a result, the MQTT `screenOn` status field stayed `true` even after sending `screenOff`. Fixed by delegating both commands to `KioskModule.turnScreenOff()` / `KioskModule.turnScreenOn()`, which call `lockNow()` and `wakeUp()` respectively. `screenOn` additionally calls `setIsScreensaverActive(false)` + `resetTimer()` to handle the case where only the overlay was active and no physical lock event fires.

- 🏠 **Dashboard mode returned to grid when tile page self-refreshes** (#159): If the "Return to Start Page on Inactivity" feature was enabled, opening a dashboard tile armed the inactivity return timer. Pages that auto-refresh (e.g. Immich kiosk, Home Assistant dashboards) did not reset the timer because `Reset on Navigation` was off by default — so the timer fired after the configured delay and returned to the dashboard grid without any user interaction. Fixed: in dashboard mode, any page navigation (including self-refresh) always resets the inactivity timer, matching the user expectation that an actively-updating page should not be treated as "inactive."

- 🌙 **Overnight rules rejected by Scheduled URLs** (#157): Recurring scheduled URL events with an end time before the start time (e.g. 22:00–07:00) were rejected with "End time must be after start time". Two fixes: (1) The validation in `RecurringEventEditor` now only rejects identical start/end times — crossing midnight is valid. (2) `isEventActive()` in `planner.ts` now detects overnight ranges (`startTime > endTime`) and handles the two sub-cases: before midnight (today is a scheduled day and `currentTime >= startTime`) and after midnight (yesterday was a scheduled day and `currentTime < endTime`). This correctly handles the case where an event starts Monday at 22:00 and is still active Tuesday at 06:30.

- 📐 **Multi-app grid tile widths cut off after device rotation** (#160): In External App mode with multiple managed apps, the app grid used `Dimensions.get('window').width` to calculate tile widths. `Dimensions` returns stale values after device rotation until the component re-renders, causing tiles to overflow or be cut off. Fixed by replacing `Dimensions` with the `useWindowDimensions()` hook, which updates reactively on orientation change.

- 🎙️ **WebRTC microphone audio silent due to missing permission** (#147): The `MODIFY_AUDIO_SETTINGS` permission was not declared in `AndroidManifest.xml`. This permission is required on Android for WebRTC to switch the audio mode to `MODE_IN_COMMUNICATION` (which activates the microphone path and echo cancellation). Without it, getUserMedia() succeeded but microphone audio was silent in WebRTC calls. Added as a normal protection level permission (auto-granted at install, no runtime prompt needed).

- 🌐 **REST API returns "Endpoint not found" for valid endpoints when called with POST** (#146): Read-only endpoints (`/api/status`, `/api/health`, `/api/info`, `/api/battery`, etc.) only accepted GET requests. Automation tools that default to POST (Home Assistant REST integration, curl `--request POST`, Node-RED HTTP node, etc.) got a misleading `404 Endpoint not found` response even though the endpoint exists — the wrong HTTP method was the only issue. Fixed by making all read-only status endpoints accept both GET and POST. The two endpoints that have both a read and write variant (`/api/brightness`, `/api/volume`) now use the HTTP method to disambiguate: GET reads the current value, POST with a body sets it. POST-only control endpoints that require a JSON body (`/api/url`, `/api/tts`, etc.) now return a proper `405 Method Not Allowed` with a clear message when called with GET, instead of the generic 404.

- 💾 **Export backup fails with "Permission denied" on Android 10+** (#166): `exportBackup()` wrote directly to `/storage/emulated/0/Download/` via `RNFS.writeFile()`. On Android 10+ (API 29+), `WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` is deprecated and silently denied, causing an EACCES crash. Fixed by switching the export flow to the Storage Access Framework: tapping Export now opens the system "Save As" dialog (`ACTION_CREATE_DOCUMENT`) where the user picks the save location. The file is then written via `ContentResolver.openOutputStream()` — no storage permission needed, works on all Android versions. The backup data collection logic is unchanged; only the write path changed. A new `saveJsonFile(content, filename)` method was added to `FilePickerModule` (Kotlin + TypeScript) to handle the SAF save dialog.

- 🔇 **Audio from previous scheduled URL continues playing after planner switches to next URL** (#158): When the URL planner transitioned between scheduled events, it called `setUrl()` to navigate the WebView to the new URL — but the previous page's JavaScript (including Web Audio, HTML5 `<audio>`, timers) kept running in the background because the same WebView instance was reused. Fixed by incrementing `webViewKey` on each planner URL transition, which forces React to fully unmount and remount the WebViewComponent. The underlying Android WebView is destroyed, terminating all background sessions. The same remount is applied when the planner reverts to the base URL at the end of a scheduled period.

## [1.2.19] - 2026-05-31

### Added
- 🌙 **Customizable screensaver content** (#47, #91, #61): The screensaver is no longer just a brightness dimmer. A new "Screensaver Style" selector in Settings → Display → Screensaver offers three modes: **Dim Only** (default, unchanged — just dims the brightness), **Web Page** (displays a read-only URL fullscreen — clock, dashboard, HTML; tap anywhere to wake), and **Video / Image** (plays a video/image playlist via the existing MediaPlayerComponent with loop, mute, fit modes). In URL and Video modes the current brightness is preserved (auto-brightness keeps working), so the screen stays visible and Android no longer turns it off — addressing wall-mounted panel use cases. Existing users are unaffected: defaults remain Dim Only. A warning is shown in settings if Screensaver Brightness is below 10% while URL/Video is selected.

- 🔐 **HTTP Basic Auth for WebView** (#113): FreeKiosk now automatically responds to HTTP 401 authentication challenges using credentials configured in Settings → General → Website Authentication. Enter a username and password; the password is stored in the Android Keychain (never in plain text). Leave the username empty to disable. Implemented via the `basicAuthCredential` prop of `react-native-webview`, which hooks into `WebViewClient.onReceivedHttpAuthRequest` natively — no JavaScript injection required and no impact on sites that don't use Basic Auth.

- 🔀 **Switch display mode via REST/MQTT (`setMode`)** (#76): A new `setMode` command allows switching between WebView mode and External App mode at runtime without restarting FreeKiosk. Send `{"mode":"webview","url":"https://..."}` to switch to WebView (the `url` field is optional), or `{"mode":"external_app","package":"com.app.name"}` to launch an app and activate the return overlay. Available via REST (`POST /api/mode`) and MQTT (`set/mode`). The transition is clean in both directions: switching to WebView stops the OverlayService and background monitor; switching to External App reads fresh overlay settings from storage to avoid stale closures, verifies the app is installed, starts the OverlayService, then launches the app.

- 🎯 **Motion detection sensitivity setting** (#125): A new "Sensitivity" radio group (Low / Medium / High) is now visible in Settings → Display → Screensaver → Motion Detection when motion detection is enabled. Previously the sensitivity was hardcoded to Medium. Low sensitivity requires larger movements to trigger (15% pixel change threshold), Medium is the default (8%), and High reacts to subtle movements (4%). The selected value is persisted and applied immediately to the camera-based motion detector.

- 🏠 **FreeKiosk can be set as the default home launcher** (#127): `MainActivity` now declares the `HOME` / `DEFAULT` intent categories alongside `LAUNCHER`. This makes FreeKiosk appear in the Android "Choose home app" picker and allows `adb shell cmd package set-home-activity "com.freekiosk/.MainActivity"` to succeed. Previously the command failed because no HOME intent-filter was declared on the main activity. This is optional — FreeKiosk only becomes the default launcher if the user (or ADB) explicitly selects it.

- 🔁 **Keep Alive / Launch on Boot in Website mode** (#37): Background apps (managed apps with "Keep Alive" or "Launch on Boot" enabled) can now be configured and monitored in Website (WebView) mode, not just App mode. A new "Background Apps" section appears in Settings → General when in Website mode. Use case: keep a music or audio receiver app (e.g. Spotify, Sendspin) alive in the background while displaying a web dashboard. The `BackgroundAppMonitorService` now runs independently of the display mode and stops itself automatically if no keep-alive apps are configured.

- 🗣️ **Web Speech API (speechSynthesis) polyfill** (#NEW): Web apps running inside the WebView can now use the standard `window.speechSynthesis.speak()` API for text-to-speech. Android WebView does not natively implement the Web Speech API (unlike Chrome), so FreeKiosk injects a transparent polyfill that bridges `speechSynthesis.speak()` → `postMessage` → native Android `TextToSpeech` engine. This means any web app that uses TTS (e.g. accessibility tools, notification readers, custom kiosk UIs) will work out of the box without code changes. Supports `speak()`, `cancel()`, `getVoices()`, `onvoiceschanged`, `SpeechSynthesisUtterance` (text, lang, rate, pitch, volume), and automatic language detection via the existing FreeKiosk TTS engine. The polyfill only activates when the native `speechSynthesis` is missing or non-functional (no voices). Also exposed `HttpServerModule.speak()` and `HttpServerModule.stopSpeaking()` as React Native bridge methods for direct native TTS access from JS. Requested by Carlos via email

- 🖨️ **Configurable print paper size** (#NEW): A new "Default Paper Size" selector appears in Settings → General → Printing when printing is enabled. Available sizes: A4, A5, A3, Letter, Legal. The selected size is used as the default in the Android print dialog — the user can still override it manually if needed. Previously the print dialog always defaulted to A4 regardless of CSS `@page` rules. Reported by Paolo Leone via email

### Fixed
- ⏳ **WebView stuck on infinite loading spinner for sites with redirect chains** (#140): On sites that respond with HTTP redirects (e.g. a homepage redirecting to a login page), `onLoadStart` fired once per redirect step and each call cleared and restarted the 10-second fallback timeout. If the site produced a rapid series of navigations (redirect chain, iframe loads, SPA internal routing), the countdown was continuously reset and never completed — leaving the loading overlay permanently on screen and hiding the actual page. Fixed by starting the fallback timer only once per loading session: if a timeout is already running, subsequent `onLoadStart` events leave it untouched. `onLoadEnd` and `onLoadProgress === 1` still cancel the timer normally when the page loads successfully. Reported by @SamuelSilvaG

- 📶 **SSID showing "Wifi" instead of network name on Android 12+ devices** (#80): On Android 12+ (API 31+), `WifiManager.connectionInfo` is deprecated and returns `<unknown ssid>` even when the location permission is granted and location services are enabled. Fixed by using `NetworkCapabilities.transportInfo` (the recommended API since Android 10) to retrieve the `WifiInfo` object on API 31+. Affects the REST API `/api/info`, MQTT status messages, and all system info endpoints. Reported by @hapishyguy

- 🔒 **Lock Mode permanently disabled after using "Exit Kiosk Mode"** (#124, #138): Calling "Exit Kiosk Mode" from the Advanced settings was writing `@kiosk_enabled=false` to AsyncStorage, which permanently disabled Lock Mode — on every subsequent launch, the kiosk started unlocked and users could escape via the home button. Root cause: the `setKioskEnabledInAsyncStorage(false)` call was added as belt-and-suspenders for the watchdog fix (#96), but the watchdog is already stopped explicitly via `stopService()` before the activity finishes, making the write unnecessary. Fixed by removing the AsyncStorage write from `exitKioskMode()` — `@kiosk_enabled` now stays `true`, so kiosk mode re-engages on the next FK launch. The DE fast-boot flag is still cleared (so `BootLockActivity` does not hard-lock on next reboot), and the watchdog is still stopped explicitly (#96 fix unaffected). Reported by @mpreusse and @Mkdir1511

- 🗣️ **TTS silent for Chinese and other non-Latin languages even when language data is installed** (#115): Root cause was that `TextToSpeech()` was initialized without specifying an engine — Android may pick a default English-only engine rather than the engine the user configured in system settings (which has Chinese/Japanese/Korean support). Fixed by initializing TTS with `Settings.Secure.getString("tts_default_engine")` so FreeKiosk uses the same engine as the system TTS test page. Also improved `parseLocale()` to use `Locale.forLanguageTag()` (proper BCP 47 parsing) instead of manual string splitting, fixing edge cases with tags like `zh-CN` or `zh_CN`. Also applied the same engine fix and added language auto-detection to MQTT's `speakText()` which previously spoke all text without ever calling `setLanguage()`. Reported by @nowpast

- 🔊 **Volume Button Alternative toggle not accessible in App mode** (#110): The "Volume Button Alternative" toggle (Settings → Security → Return to Settings) was hidden when display mode was set to App. It is now visible in all modes. The toggle description in App mode now clarifies that the feature is active by default and may cause accidental PIN triggers during normal volume adjustment — users who do not need it in App mode can disable it here. Reported by @Mkdir1511

- 🔒 **Kiosk not locked during Android boot on low-end / slow devices** (#98): After reboot, there was a window of 15–60 seconds where the device was unprotected while React Native loaded. This was partially fixed in v1.2.17 by `BootLockActivity` (a pure-native activity that enters lock-task in under a second), but the fix was incomplete: `ACTION_LOCKED_BOOT_COMPLETED` fires before Android decrypts CE (user-encrypted) storage, so the SQLite/AsyncStorage reads used to check kiosk settings all returned their safe default (`false`), preventing `BootLockActivity` from launching at all. Fixed by using DE (Device Encrypted) `SharedPreferences` — readable at any point during the boot process — to persist whether the fast-boot lock should activate. The DE flag is written: (a) whenever `startLockTask` / `exitKioskMode` is called from the app, and (b) at every normal `ACTION_BOOT_COMPLETED` so it stays in sync. At `ACTION_LOCKED_BOOT_COMPLETED`, only the DE flag is read (no SQLite). Additionally, if `BootLockActivity` was launched at `LOCKED_BOOT_COMPLETED` but `MainActivity` (which is not Direct Boot–aware) couldn't start yet, the activity now retries launching `MainActivity` every 5 seconds in its poll loop until CE storage becomes available. Reported by @rarcher

- 🔁 **Launch on Boot causes infinite loop in External App mode** (#37): Enabling "Launch on Boot" on a managed app (e.g. Velocity) while in External App mode caused the device to enter an unrecoverable loop — the screen cycled continuously between FreeKiosk and the external app until FreeKiosk was uninstalled. Three root causes fixed: (1) `launchBootApps()` was called on every `loadSettings()` invocation (including returns from Settings or PIN screen), not only on genuine app startup — a `bootAppsLaunchedRef` guard now ensures it fires at most once per app session; (2) `AppLauncherModule.launchBootApps()` called `bringFreeKioskToFront()` after launching the boot app, which triggered `MainActivity.onResume()` fast-path while `loadSettings` was still running — this caused a second native relaunch of the external app and a double-start of `OverlayService`, creating an unstable monitoring loop; (3) `OverlayService` is now started with the primary app's package **before** `launchBootApps()` is called (single-app mode only), so kiosk protection is active from the moment the boot app appears in the foreground — no unprotected window. As a bonus, `BootReceiver.launchMainActivityLegacy()` no longer calls `Thread.sleep()` on the main looper (replaced by a nested `postDelayed`), eliminating an ANR risk on Android 14+ devices. Reported by Tom Schiettecat (Hupac Intermodal)

- 📄 **PDF Viewer fails to load PDFs from CDN/WAF-protected servers** (#BUG): PDFs hosted behind CDN/WAFs like Alibaba Cloud (e.g. byd.com) failed to load in the built-in PDF.js viewer with "Unable to load PDF" error. Three root causes fixed: (1) **Missing Referer header** — the native PDF proxy now injects `Referer: <pdf_url>` when the WebView doesn't send one (which is always the case from `file://` origins), preventing WAF anti-hotlink blocks; (2) **Lost session cookies** — `Set-Cookie` headers from proxied responses (e.g. Alibaba's `acw_tc` WAF cookie) are now persisted back into Android's `CookieManager` so subsequent requests include them; (3) **Range request failures** — PDF.js was making multiple range requests that lost WAF session state between requests, now uses `disableRange: true` for a single full-download request for maximum compatibility. Also improved viewer error messages to include the truncated URL for easier debugging. Reported by Martin Lemke via email
- 📄 **PDF opened via popup (`window.open`) blocked by URL filtering**: When a website opened a PDF link via `window.open()` (popup), the `onOpenWindow` handler checked URL filtering **before** checking for PDF interception — causing the PDF to be blocked in whitelist mode even with the PDF viewer enabled. PDF detection now runs first in `onOpenWindow`, consistent with `onShouldStartLoadWithRequest`. Reported by Martin Lemke via email
- 🎥 **Back button overlay disappears behind camera apps in fullscreen** (#121): In External App / Multi-App mode, FreeKiosk's return overlay (back button and 5-tap exit zone) disappeared when camera apps (Google Camera, Open Camera) entered their fullscreen viewfinder mode. Root cause: camera apps use a hardware-accelerated `SurfaceView` whose compositor layer can render above `TYPE_APPLICATION_OVERLAY` windows after certain window state transitions. Fix: `OverlayService` now runs a periodic re-pin loop (every 3 s) while an external app is locked — it removes and immediately re-adds the overlay to `WindowManager`, placing it back at the top of the overlay stack. Also added `FLAG_HARDWARE_ACCELERATED` to overlay window params for correct compositing. Note: camera apps that call `SurfaceView.setZOrderOnTop(true)` permanently may still briefly occlude the overlay between re-pin cycles; the volume-button 5-tap exit (Settings → Security) remains available as an always-reachable alternative. Reported by @jmynes

- ⌨️ **Soft keyboard persists after screen sleep** (#135): When a kiosk page had an input focused (e.g. Force Numeric mode on a login screen) and the device timed out, the soft keyboard remained visible on the next screen-on instead of being dismissed with the sleep event. Fixed by calling `InputMethodManager.hideSoftInputFromWindow()` (+ `clearFocus()`) in `ScreenStateReceiver` when `ACTION_SCREEN_OFF` is received. Reported by @asfreitas17

- 📱 **Display settings tab crashes on Android 8.x (StackOverflowError in Slider)** (#86): Opening Settings → Display on Android 8.x (API 26–27) triggered an immediate `StackOverflowError` and crashed the app. Root cause: on Android 8, `AppCompatSeekBar.setMax()` internally calls `setProgressInternal()` → `refreshProgress()` → `onProgressRefresh()` → `onProgressChanged()` on the registered listener. The listener then called `seekbar.setProgress()` to clamp the value, which re-triggered `onProgressChanged()` recursively until the stack overflowed. An earlier fix attempt (v1.2.16-beta.1) added a JS-side local state wrapper in `SettingsSlider` to reduce parent re-renders during drag, but the crash happened at **initialization** time (when React Native applies `minimumValue` / `maximumValue` props via the native bridge) so the JS fix had no effect. Root fix: added a `mIsSettingProgress` re-entrancy guard directly in `ReactSliderManager.onProgressChanged()` via a patch-package patch on `@react-native-community/slider@5.1.1` — the guard returns immediately if re-entered, breaking the recursive loop. Reported by @gauthier-th

## [1.2.18] - 2026-03-30

### Added
- 🖨️ **Allow Printing toggle** (#NEW): New "Allow Printing" setting (off by default) in General → Printing that enables `window.print()` support in kiosk mode. When enabled: (1) the `window.print()` JavaScript call is intercepted and routed to Android's native `PrintManager`, (2) print spooler packages (`com.android.printspooler` + all installed print services like Samsung Print, HP Print, etc.) are dynamically discovered via `queryIntentServices` and automatically whitelisted in Lock Task mode so the system print dialog can appear, (3) immersive mode is suspended while the print dialog is open and re-applied after it closes, (4) `onResume` lock task re-entry is deferred during printing to avoid killing the print UI, and (5) `data:` URLs are allowed in the WebView to support popup-based print flows (label printers, receipt generators). Supports WiFi, Bluetooth, USB printers and Save as PDF. Requested by @Poppy
- ☀️ **Auto-Brightness Offset** (#92): New slider in Display → Auto-Brightness settings that lets you add a fixed percentage offset to the calculated auto-brightness value. For example, setting +10% means if the light sensor calculates 30% brightness, FreeKiosk will apply 40% instead. Useful when auto-brightness is consistently too dim for your environment but you still want it to adapt to ambient light. The offset is clamped at 100% maximum. Available in the settings UI (0–50% range with 5% steps) and via the REST API (`POST /api/autoBrightness/enable` now accepts an optional `offset` parameter, 0–100). Requested by @Delivator

### Fixed
- **TTS silent for non-English text** (#115): `/api/tts` only spoke English and was completely silent for Chinese, Japanese, Korean and other non-Latin text because `TextToSpeech.setLanguage()` was never called — the engine defaulted to English. Added automatic language detection based on Unicode script analysis (CJK → Chinese, Hangul → Korean, Hiragana/Katakana → Japanese, Arabic, Thai, Hindi, Cyrillic, etc.). Also added an optional `language` parameter (BCP 47 tag, e.g. `"zh-CN"`, `"ja"`, `"ko"`) for explicit control. The locale is now set before each `speak()` call. Requires the target language TTS voice data to be installed on the device. Reported by @nowpast
- **Some packages do not show up in app picker** (#112): Packages without a launchable UI (services, VPN tools like gnirehtet, etc.) were excluded from the managed apps picker because `getInstalledApps()` filtered on `getLaunchIntentForPackage() != null`. Added a new native method `getAllInstalledApps()` that includes user-installed (non-system) packages even when they have no launcher activity. The managed apps picker now uses this method and offers a **"Show all packages"** toggle (off by default) to reveal background services/VPNs. Non-UI apps display a "service" badge for clarity. The single-app primary picker remains launcher-only since launching a non-UI package as the main app is not meaningful. Reported by @Royalflamejlh
- **ADB configuration doesn't support multi-app mode** (#111): Added `external_app_mode` and `managed_apps` ADB intent extras to configure multi-app mode via ADB. You can now set `--es external_app_mode "multi"` and provide a JSON array of apps with `--es managed_apps '[{"packageName":"com.app1"},{"packageName":"com.app2"}]'`. Each app supports `showOnHomeScreen`, `launchOnBoot`, `keepAlive`, and `allowAccessibility` flags. Both individual intent extras and full JSON config (`--es config '{...}'`) are supported. Uninstalled packages are silently skipped. Display names are auto-resolved from the system if not provided. Reported by @Royalflamejlh
- **Volume buttons trigger PIN request when held** (#110): Holding the volume button to adjust volume would trigger the PIN request because both `MainActivity.onKeyDown` and `VolumeChangeReceiver` counted auto-repeat/rapid events as separate taps. Fixed by ignoring `KeyEvent` with `repeatCount > 0` in `MainActivity`, and adding a minimum 250ms interval between counted volume changes in `VolumeChangeReceiver` to filter out the rapid events (~50-100ms) generated by holding the button. Deliberate separate presses (≥250ms apart) still work normally. Reported by @Mkdir1511
- **Crash on boot with Lock Mode enabled** (#109): `BootLockActivity` crashed immediately on boot with a `NullPointerException` in `hideSystemUI()` because `window.insetsController` was called before `setContentView()`. On Android R+ (API 30+), this internally accesses the `DecorView` which is only created by `setContentView()` — so the DecorView was `null`. Fixed by reordering the calls so `setContentView()` runs first, and added a try-catch safety net in `hideSystemUI()` for extra robustness on devices with unusual boot timing. Only affected v1.2.17-beta.1; v1.2.16 was unaffected because it didn't have `BootLockActivity`. Reported by @sharkooon
- **Backup import from other devices / ADB push not working** (#107): On Android 11+ (Scoped Storage), backup files pushed via `adb push` or copied from another device were invisible to the import list because `RNFS.readDir()` can only see files created by the app itself. Added a **"Browse device for backup file..."** button in the import modal that uses Android's Storage Access Framework (SAF) via `ACTION_OPEN_DOCUMENT` to open the native file picker — this bypasses Scoped Storage restrictions entirely. The JSON content is read directly through `ContentResolver` (no file copy needed). Also added `importBackupFromContent()` and `parseBackupContent()` to `BackupService` for content-based import/preview, and improved the empty-state message to guide users toward the browse button. Reported by @sharkooon
- 📖 **Device Owner setup incorrectly requires factory reset** (#68): Updated all setup documentation (README, INSTALL.md, ADB_CONFIG.md, FAQ) to clarify that a factory reset is **not** required to activate Device Owner. Android's actual requirement is that no user accounts are active on the device — users can simply sign out of all accounts, run the `dpm` command, and sign back in. Factory reset is now documented as a fallback only. Also added notes about SIM profiles/accounts that some devices retain. Reported by @realAllonZ, confirmed by @hapishyguy
- **WebView blocked by hosting providers (SiteGround, etc.)**: The hardcoded User-Agent (`Chrome/120.0.0.0` on `X11; Linux x86_64`) was outdated and had a platform mismatch — hosting WAFs flagged it as a bot. Updated the default UA to a modern Chrome 131 on Android (`Mozilla/5.0 (Linux; Android 13; Pixel 6) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/131.0.0.0 Mobile Safari/537.36`). Also added a new **Custom User Agent** setting in Display settings, allowing users to override the UA string if specific sites require it
- **Screen Sleep Schedule not saving in App mode** (#103): The Screen Sleep Scheduler settings (enabled, rules, wake-on-touch) were only persisted when in Website or Media Player mode. In External App mode, the save function forcibly reset `screenSchedulerEnabled` to `false` and discarded all rules — even though the UI allowed configuring them in all modes. Moved scheduler save calls out of the mode-conditional block so they are now saved unconditionally, consistent with how they are loaded and executed. Reported by @hungrycactus
- **MQTT audio commands not working** (#102): `audio_play`, `audio_beep`, and `audio_stop` MQTT commands were not functional while their REST API equivalents worked fine. The MQTT path forwarded audio commands to JS (`ApiService.ts`) which had no handler for them, whereas the REST API handled them natively in Kotlin (`HttpServerModule`). Added native audio handling (`MediaPlayer`, `AudioTrack`) directly in `MqttModule.kt`, matching the existing REST API implementation. Reported by @zeroping
- **MQTT still fails on older devices after #97 fix** (#97): On older devices (Android 11 and below), R8 obfuscation of HiveMQ's internal classes (Dagger 2 IoC components, staged auth builder interfaces, lazy `InstanceHolder` factories) caused `AbstractMethodError` or `IncompatibleClassChangeError` on older ART runtimes when the auth code path was taken. Added comprehensive ProGuard keep rules for HiveMQ, Dagger, javax.inject, and RxJava. Hardened error handling with `catch (Throwable)` (instead of `catch (Exception)`) to properly catch `Error` subclasses from Netty/Dagger static initialization and propagate them to the UI
- **Kiosk Watchdog not stopping on exit** (#96): Fixed KioskWatchdogService continuing to run (and relaunching the app) after intentionally exiting kiosk mode. The watchdog now writes `@kiosk_enabled=false` to AsyncStorage and explicitly stops the service before closing the activity. Also clears the watchdog notification on exit. Reported by @krheinwald

## [1.2.17] - 2026-03-11

### Added
- 🔒 **Boot Lock Activity** (#98): New lightweight native Android activity (`BootLockActivity`) that enters lock-task mode immediately after boot — before React Native loads. On low-spec devices (e.g. Nokia C210) where RN can take 1-2 minutes to initialize, this eliminates the window where users could interact with the OS freely. The activity shows a minimal loading screen (app icon + spinner) and automatically hands off to MainActivity once React Native is ready. Only activates for Device Owner installs with kiosk mode enabled; non-DO installs use the existing delayed-launch path
- 🛡️ **Kiosk Watchdog Service** (#96): New `KioskWatchdogService` foreground service using `START_STICKY` flag to survive OOM kills. On low-RAM devices (e.g. 2GB AndroidTV), if the browser consumes too much memory and the kernel kills FreeKiosk, the watchdog automatically relaunches it within seconds. Includes relaunch cooldown (15s) to prevent relaunch storms, self-disables when kiosk mode is turned off, and uses a silent minimal-priority notification
- 🎬 **Media Player Mode** (#NEW): Brand-new display mode alongside Website and External App. Play videos and images in full-screen kiosk mode with playlist support. Features include:
  - **Local file support**: Pick videos and images directly from the device via Android's native file picker. Files are copied to app internal storage for reliable WebView playback. Supports single and multi-file selection with filter by type (video/image/any). Local files show a 📱 badge and filename in the playlist
  - **Native FilePickerModule**: New Kotlin native module (`FilePickerModule.kt`) using `ACTION_OPEN_DOCUMENT` intent with `ActivityEventListener` for result handling. Copies selected `content://` URIs to `files/media_player/` with unique naming. Includes `deleteMediaFile`, `listMediaFiles`, `clearMediaFiles` helpers
  - **Remote URL support**: Also accepts remote `http://` and `https://` URLs for hosted media content
  - **Playlist management**: Add multiple media URLs or pick local files from General settings, with auto-detection of media type based on file extension or MIME type
  - **Video support**: MP4, WebM, OGG formats with optional mute toggle
  - **Image support**: PNG, JPG, GIF, SVG, WebP with configurable per-item or default display duration (seconds)
  - **Playback options**: Auto-play, loop, shuffle, and optional on-screen controls (prev/play-pause/next with progress bar)
  - **Display options**: Fit mode (contain/cover/fill), background color, crossfade transitions with configurable duration
  - **Full kiosk integration**: Brightness control, screensaver, screen always on, status bar, lock mode, volume button return, and touch blocking all work identically to Website mode
  - **WebView-based rendering**: Uses an embedded HTML5 player via react-native-webview with `allowFileAccess`, `allowFileAccessFromFileURLs`, and `allowUniversalAccessFromFileURLs` enabled for local file playback. Dual-slot crossfade transitions
  - **Error handling**: Auto-skips unplayable items with retry, shows friendly empty state when no items configured
  - **Settings persistence**: All media player settings saved to AsyncStorage (including `isLocal` and `fileName` fields), included in backup/restore, and properly reset
  - **Android 13+ permissions**: Added `READ_MEDIA_VIDEO` and `READ_MEDIA_IMAGES` permissions for granular media access on Android 13+
- 📊 **Dashboard Mode**: New display mode that shows a configurable grid of URL tiles instead of a single WebView. Users can create tiles with custom names and URLs, each automatically assigned a distinct color. Tapping a tile opens its URL in the WebView with a navigation bar (back/forward/refresh/home). Configurable in Settings → Dashboard tab
- 📱 **Multi-App Mode** (#67): External App mode now supports managing multiple apps. Add apps from the new "Managed Apps" section in General settings — each app appears on a home screen grid with icon circles. All managed apps are automatically whitelisted in Lock Task Mode, so users can switch between them without escaping the kiosk. The primary app (single package) still works exactly as before for backward compatibility
- 🚀 **Launch App on Boot** (#37): Managed apps with "Launch on Boot" enabled are automatically started in the background when the device boots, before FreeKiosk's own UI loads. Combined with "Keep Alive", apps can be maintained as persistent background services
- 💓 **Keep Alive Background Monitor** (#37): New `BackgroundAppMonitorService` foreground service checks every 30 seconds (via `UsageStatsManager`) if managed apps with "Keep Alive" enabled are still running, and relaunches them if they've stopped or crashed. Starts automatically on boot when at least one keep-alive app is configured
- ♿ **Accessibility Whitelist for Other Apps** (#66): Device Owners can now allow other apps' accessibility services via a per-app "Allow Accessibility" toggle in Managed Apps settings. Uses `DevicePolicyManager.setPermittedAccessibilityServices()` to whitelist selected packages alongside FreeKiosk's own service. Applied at boot, on save, and when enabling via Device Owner
- ⚙️ **Android Settings Button** (#89): New "Android System Settings" section in the Advanced tab with a main button to open the native Android settings, plus quick-access shortcuts for WiFi, Sound, Display, Bluetooth, Date & Time, and Apps. Fully compatible with Lock Task Mode (kiosk): automatically pauses the lock, opens the settings, and re-engages kiosk mode when the user returns to FreeKiosk. An info banner warns when kiosk mode is active. Useful for devices with no physical navigation buttons where ADB commands are restricted by Admin mode
- 🔍 **WebView Zoom Level** (Display settings): New slider to control how web pages are rendered in WebView mode. Range: 50%–200%, default 100% (matches Chrome's default rendering). Quick presets at 75%, 100%, 125%, 150%. An info hint appears when zoom is not at default. Persisted to storage and included in backup/restore. Only available in WebView mode

### Changed
- 🏪 **Play Store compliance: conditional self-update** (#playstore): In-app self-update via GitHub (check for updates, download APK, install) is now completely disabled when building for the Play Store. A single Gradle flag (`-Pplaystore`) controls everything at compile time — no separate codebase needed. When active: `REQUEST_INSTALL_PACKAGES` permission is removed from the merged manifest, `UpdateInstallReceiver` is disabled, the entire "Updates" UI section is hidden from Settings → Advanced, and all native update methods become no-ops. R8 strips the dead update code from the final bytecode. Normal sideload/F-Droid builds (`./gradlew assembleRelease`) remain fully functional with self-update enabled. Play Store builds: `./gradlew bundleRelease -Pplaystore`

### Fixed
- 🔊 **Volume buttons trigger PIN request when held** (#110): Holding the volume button to adjust volume would trigger the PIN request because both `MainActivity.onKeyDown` and `VolumeChangeReceiver` counted auto-repeat/rapid events as separate taps. Fixed by ignoring `KeyEvent` with `repeatCount > 0` in `MainActivity`, and adding a minimum 250ms interval between counted volume changes in `VolumeChangeReceiver` to filter out the rapid events (~50-100ms) generated by holding the button. Deliberate separate presses (>=250ms apart) still work normally. Reported by @Mkdir1511

Deliberate separate presses (≥250ms apart) still work normally. Reported by @Mkdir1511
- 📡 **MQTT doesn't connect when password is set** (#97): Fixed a crash in the password masking logic used for debug logging — `String.repeat(password.length - 6)` produced a negative count for passwords shorter than 7 characters, throwing `IllegalArgumentException` before the MQTT client was even built. This silently aborted `connect()`, resulting in zero network traffic and an immediate return to "Disconnected". Also fixed authentication being skipped entirely when a password was configured without a username (the auth block was gated on `!username.isNullOrBlank()` only)
- 🔄 **Inactivity Return now works in Dashboard Mode**: Previously, enabling "Inactivity Return" with Dashboard Mode had no effect because the feature required a base URL (which is empty in dashboard mode). Now correctly returns to the dashboard grid after the configured timeout
- 🔄 **URL Planner return to dashboard grid**: When a scheduled planner event ended while in Dashboard Mode, the app did not return to the dashboard grid due to a stale closure in the planner callback. Fixed by using a ref to track the active event
- ♿ **Accessibility auto-enable fails with "Permission denial: WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS"** (#99): The "Enable Automatically (Device Owner)" button crashed because `Settings.Secure.putString()` requires `android.permission.WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS`, which is not automatically granted to Device Owners. Added the permission to the manifest, wrapped the secure settings write in a `SecurityException` catch with a specific `WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS_REQUIRED` error code, and improved the UI to show a clear dialog with the one-time ADB command (`adb shell pm grant com.freekiosk android.permission.WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS`). The "Open Accessibility Settings" manual fallback remains available. `BootReceiver` also handles the missing permission gracefully instead of crashing silently. Updated ADB provisioning scripts and troubleshooting docs
- 🔒 **PIN bypass via back gesture** (#93): Fixed a security issue where swiping back (Android predictive back gesture) from the Settings or PIN screen could bypass PIN protection on Android 16+ devices (e.g. Lenovo Idea Tab Pro). Disabled swipe-back gestures on PIN and Settings screens, added `BackHandler` to block hardware/gesture back navigation, and replaced `navigation.navigate` with `navigation.reset` to fully clear the navigation stack when returning to kiosk mode
- 📦 **Self-update fails with "No storage permission"** (#88): The APK download used `setDestinationInExternalPublicDir()` which requires `WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` runtime permission — never requested at runtime. Switched to `setDestinationInExternalFilesDir()` (app-private directory), eliminating the storage permission requirement entirely. Old downloaded APKs are now cleaned up automatically before each new download
- 📦 **Self-update fails to install on Android 8+** (#88): After downloading, the APK install was blocked because "Install from unknown sources" was not enabled for the app. Added a pre-download permission check (`canRequestPackageInstalls()`) with a user-friendly dialog that opens the system settings page to grant the permission. On restricted devices (e.g. Amazon Echo Show / Fire OS) where the settings page doesn't exist, a clear fallback message guides the user to use `adb install -r <apk>` instead
- 🔧 **Duplicate import in HttpServerModule** (#88): Removed duplicate `android.location.LocationManager` import that caused Kotlin compilation failure
- 🎮 **Remote control now works natively like a physical keyboard** (#85): Remote key commands (`/api/remote/up`, `down`, `left`, `right`, `select`, `back`, `home`, `menu`, `playpause`) were previously routed through a JavaScript round-trip via React Native bridge, which prevented them from behaving like real hardware key presses. Now handled entirely in native code — dispatched via the AccessibilityService (cross-app D-pad navigation with UI element highlighting) or `activity.dispatchKeyEvent()` (in-app fallback). On /e/OS, LineageOS, and other custom ROMs, this enables proper focus-based UI navigation identical to a physical remote/keyboard
- 📡 **MQTT now supports remote control and keyboard commands** (#85): Added 12 new MQTT command topics for full remote control parity with the REST API — `remote_up`, `remote_down`, `remote_left`, `remote_right`, `remote_select`, `remote_back`, `remote_home`, `remote_menu`, `remote_playpause`, `keyboard_key`, `keyboard_combo`, `keyboard_text`. Home Assistant Discovery registers 9 new button entities (remote D-pad) and 3 new text entities (keyboard input), bringing the total from 30 to 42 auto-discovered entities
- 📡 **MQTT background persistence** (#80): MQTT now stays alive when the app is in background or the screen is off, with 4 layers of protection: (1) `PARTIAL_WAKE_LOCK` + `WIFI_MODE_FULL_HIGH_PERF` keep CPU and WiFi active for MQTT PING packets, (2) `NetworkCallback` detects WiFi recovery and triggers immediate reconnect instead of waiting for TCP timeout + exponential backoff, (3) OverlayService watchdog checks MQTT health every 60 seconds from the existing foreground service, (4) `SCREEN_ON` receiver triggers an instant MQTT reconnect check when the screen wakes up
- 🏷️ **MQTT Device Name prompt on every keystroke** (#80): Changing the Device Name no longer triggers a reconnect popup on every key press. The reconnect prompt now only appears once when the field loses focus (onBlur), so you can finish typing the full name before being asked to reconnect
- 📶 **WiFi `connected` field reporting true when not on WiFi** (#80): MQTT status and REST API used `ipAddress != "0.0.0.0"` to determine WiFi connection, which returned `true` if the device had cellular data, Ethernet, or USB tethering. Now uses `ConnectivityManager.getNetworkCapabilities(TRANSPORT_WIFI)` consistently across all 3 modules (SystemInfoModule, MqttModule, HttpServerModule) — only returns `true` when actually connected to WiFi
- 📶 **SSID shows "WiFi" instead of actual network name** (#80): When Android blocks SSID access (missing location permission or location services disabled), the app now shows a diagnostic message — `"WiFi (no permission)"` or `"WiFi (location off)"` — instead of silently showing `"WiFi"`, so users can identify and fix the issue. Also handles the `0x` edge case on some Chinese tablets

## [1.2.16] - 2026-03-03

### Added
- 💤 **"Keep Screen On" toggle** (#83): New option in Display settings to disable `FLAG_KEEP_SCREEN_ON`. When turned off, the Android system manages screen timeout normally — the display turns off after the device's configured inactivity period, just like a regular device. Default is ON (standard kiosk behavior — no change for existing users). Screensaver is automatically disabled and hidden when this option is off, since the system handles sleep. Only available in WebView mode (External App mode already delegates screen management to the system). Included in backup/restore and reset. REST API / MQTT `screensaverOn` command is ignored when keep-screen-on is disabled
- 📊 **Device hardware info in MQTT & REST API** (#80): Status now includes `manufacturer`, `model`, `androidVersion`, `apiLevel`, `processor`, `deviceName`, `product`, and `uptime` fields in both MQTT status and REST API `/api/status`. Home Assistant Discovery now registers 5 new sensors: Manufacturer, Model, Android Version, Processor, and Uptime
- 📊 **Real device info in Home Assistant Discovery**: Device block now shows actual manufacturer and model (e.g., "Samsung Galaxy Tab A") instead of hardcoded "FreeKiosk by FreeKiosk". Added `hw_version` with Android version info

### Fixed
- 🔊 **Volume buttons trigger PIN request when held** (#110): Holding the volume button to adjust volume would trigger the PIN request because both `MainActivity.onKeyDown` and `VolumeChangeReceiver` counted auto-repeat/rapid events as separate taps.

Deliberate separate presses (≥250ms apart) still work normally. Reported by @Mkdir1511
- **Accessibility service persistence** (#80): Added `android:isAccessibilityTool="true"` to prevent Android 12+ from auto-disabling the service after inactivity. Added automatic re-enablement on boot when app is Device Owner — the accessibility service is now programmatically re-enabled in `BootReceiver` using Device Owner privileges, surviving reboots without manual intervention
- 📡 **MQTT disconnects when app goes to background** (#80): Added `AppState` listener that detects when the app returns to foreground and automatically reconnects MQTT if the connection was lost during background/Doze mode. Devices now recover their MQTT connection seamlessly
- 🏷️ **MQTT Device Name not updating** (#80): Changing the Device Name in MQTT settings now prompts the user to reconnect, ensuring the new name takes effect in topics and Home Assistant discovery. Previously the old name/ID persisted until a manual disconnect/connect cycle
- 🏷️ **MQTT Device Name pre-filled with device model** (#80): The Device Name field now auto-fills with the Android device model (e.g., "SM-T510", "Pixel 7") on first use, instead of generating a random hex ID. Makes it easy to identify devices in a fleet
- 🧪 **ExecuteJS command reliability** (#80): Fixed `executeJs` (via REST API and MQTT) silently failing when: (a) the same JS code was sent twice in a row (React state didn't change), (b) the page was still loading. Now appends a unique marker to force re-execution, and retries up to 5 seconds if the page is loading
- 📶 **SSID reporting inconsistency** (#80): Fixed `<unknown ssid>` being passed through raw in `SystemInfoModule` (Status Bar) — now consistently shows "WiFi" as fallback across all modules when location permission prevents SSID access
- �📷 **Camera2 fallback for devices where CameraX fails entirely** (MediaTek LEGACY, front-only cameras): On some devices, CameraX's `CameraValidator` permanently rejects the camera (e.g. front-only devices where BACK camera verification fails), so vision-camera never reports any cameras. Added a Camera2 API fallback: the settings screen now queries `Camera2` directly via a new `getCamera2Devices()` native method when CameraX returns nothing, and the motion detector automatically switches to Camera2-based photo capture (`captureCamera2Photo()`) when vision-camera has no device — enabling motion detection on hardware that CameraX cannot handle
- 🐛 **Fixed crash (CalledFromWrongThreadException) when entering standby/screensaver** (#82): Native events (`onScheduledSleep`, `onScheduledWake`, `navigateToPin`, `onScreenStateChanged`, API commands) were triggering React state updates synchronously on the `mqt_v_native` thread, causing `react-native-screens` to manipulate the Android view hierarchy from a non-UI thread. Wrapped all native event callbacks with `setTimeout(cb, 0)` to defer state updates to the next event loop tick, ensuring React commits go through proper UI thread dispatch
- 🐛 **Fixed invisible PIN input on dark mode devices** (#81): The PIN `TextInput` had no explicit `color` set, so Android dark mode overrode the text/dot color to white — making input invisible against the white background. Added explicit `color: '#333333'` and `placeholderTextColor` to ensure dots and placeholder are always visible regardless of system theme

## [1.2.15] - 2026-02-26

### Added
- 💡 **Allow system brightness management** (#65): New toggle "App Brightness Control" in Display settings. When disabled, FreeKiosk never touches screen brightness — system tools like Tasker, Android adaptive brightness, or other automation apps retain full control. Applies to both WebView and External App modes. All brightness-related UI (manual slider, auto-brightness, screensaver brightness) is hidden when disabled. REST API brightness commands are also ignored when disabled.
- 🧪 **Beta update channel**: Opt-in toggle to receive pre-release versions before stable releases
  - New "🧪 Beta Updates" toggle in the Updates section (Settings → Advanced)
  - When enabled, the in-app updater checks GitHub pre-releases (tagged `v1.2.15-beta.1`, etc.)
  - When disabled (default), behavior is unchanged — only stable releases are shown
  - Update alert shows a 🧪 badge and "(pre-release)" label for beta versions
  - Semver-aware version comparison: `1.2.15-beta.1 < 1.2.15-beta.2 < 1.2.15` (stable always wins)
  - No downgrade: switching beta OFF won't propose installing an older stable over a newer beta

### Fixed
- 🔊 **Volume buttons trigger PIN request when held** (#110): Holding the volume button to adjust volume would trigger the PIN request because both `MainActivity.onKeyDown` and `VolumeChangeReceiver` counted auto-repeat/rapid events as separate taps.

- 🔐 **MQTT password field adding extra characters**: Removed custom bullet-masking logic in `SettingsInput` and replaced with native `secureTextEntry` — same fix as PinInput (v1.2.5). Custom masking reconstructed the real value from display text lengths, which broke with Samsung/Gboard predictive text, autocorrect, and paste, silently injecting extra characters. Affects MQTT password, API key, and all other password fields using `SettingsInput`.
- **REST API camera photo endpoint returns "Invalid or missing API key" after settings change**: `ApiSettingsSection` now always restarts the HTTP server with the current stored settings when the REST API settings page is opened. Previously, if the server was started by `KioskScreen` with an API key that was later cleared in settings, the running server kept its stale config (the JS settings page found it "already running" and skipped re-applying the new config). Also fixed a related race condition in the port/key/control change handlers where they checked a potentially-stale React `serverRunning` state instead of querying the native module.
- 🔧 **Motion detection shows "No cameras available" on non-standard SoCs** (Rockchip, Amlogic, etc.): react-native-vision-camera's ProcessCameraProvider initializes asynchronously — on slow hardware it resolves after the settings screen already read the empty camera list; fixed by subscribing to `CameraDevicesChanged` so the UI updates as soon as cameras become available

***

## [1.2.14] - 2026-02-23

### Added
- 🔌 **MQTT Configuration via ADB intents**: Configure all MQTT settings headlessly for automated tablet provisioning
  - 11 parameters supported: `mqtt_enabled`, `mqtt_broker_url`, `mqtt_port`, `mqtt_username`, `mqtt_password`, `mqtt_client_id`, `mqtt_base_topic`, `mqtt_discovery_prefix`, `mqtt_status_interval`, `mqtt_allow_control`, `mqtt_device_name`
  - MQTT password stored securely in Android Keychain, same pattern as PIN
  - Example usage:
    ```bash
    adb shell am start -n com.freekiosk/.MainActivity \
        --es mqtt_enabled "true" \
        --es mqtt_broker_url "broker.local" \
        --es mqtt_port "1883" \
        --es mqtt_username "user" \
        --es mqtt_password "pass"
    ```
- 🔒 **TLS/SSL MQTT support**: New `useTls` config option — auto-enabled when port is 8883
- 🔔 **MQTT connection errors surfaced to UI**: Broker errors (e.g. `NOT_AUTHORIZED`) now propagate from native Kotlin → JS → Settings UI — no more silent failures
- 💾 **Password saved hint**: Shows "Password is saved" when a password is already configured, preventing accidental overwrites

### Fixed
- 🔊 **Volume buttons trigger PIN request when held** (#110): Holding the volume button to adjust volume would trigger the PIN request because both `MainActivity.onKeyDown` and `VolumeChangeReceiver` counted auto-repeat/rapid events as separate taps. Fixed by ignoring `KeyEvent` with `repeatCount > 0` in `MainActivity`, and adding a minimum 250ms interval between counted volume changes in `VolumeChangeReceiver` to filter out the rapid events (~50-100ms) generated by holding the button.

Deliberate separate presses (≥250ms apart) still work normally. Reported by @Mkdir1511
- 🔄 **MQTT reconnect losing credentials**: HiveMQ's `automaticReconnect()` was sending `null` username/password on reconnection, causing the broker to reject with `NOT_AUTHORIZED`. Replaced with manual reconnect that always sends full credentials, with exponential backoff (1s → 30s)
- 🏗️ **Release build crash (R8/ProGuard)**: R8 obfuscation was renaming Netty/JCTools fields used via `Unsafe.objectFieldOffset()` reflection, causing `ExceptionInInitializerError` on startup in release builds. Added official HiveMQ ProGuard rules (`-keepclassmembernames`)
- 📋 **Password paste truncated to one character**: MQTT password field was incorrectly capturing only the last character on paste (`slice(-1)` → `slice(-charsAdded)`)
- ⌨️ **Broker URL keyboard adding spaces after dots**: Fixed by setting `keyboardType="url"` on the broker URL input
- 🔁 **Connect button ALREADY_RUNNING error**: `handleConnect` now stops the existing MQTT client before starting a new one
- 🔄 **External App Mode: child activities no longer killed by auto-relaunch** (#69): barcode scanners, file pickers, camera intents, and other child activities launched by the locked app are now properly detected and allowed
  - Uses `ActivityManager.runningAppProcesses` to check if the locked app's process is still alive (not crashed) — if alive and foreground is not a launcher, it's a child activity
  - Launchers (Home screen) are dynamically detected via `PackageManager.queryIntentActivities(ACTION_MAIN, CATEGORY_HOME)` — works on all OEMs without hardcoding
  - Safe in Lock Task mode: user cannot open other apps, only the locked app can launch child activities
  - Logic: launcher detected → relaunch FreeKiosk; locked app process alive → allow child activity; process dead → relaunch FreeKiosk
  - Fixes use cases: MLKit barcode scanner, camera intents, file pickers, permission dialogs, any native modal launched by the locked app
- 🚀 **External App Mode boot: REST API now starts automatically**: When FreeKiosk is set as default launcher in External App Mode, `HomeActivity` now also starts `MainActivity` in background
  - Ensures REST API server, MQTT, and other services are running even when an external app is in foreground
  - `MainActivity` automatically moves to background (`moveTaskToBack`) when started from `HomeActivity`
  - Fixes issue where the external app would start but FreeKiosk's API server wouldn't be accessible

## [1.2.13] - 2026-02-20

### Added
- 📡 **MQTT + Home Assistant Auto-Discovery**: Native MQTT client with full HA integration
  - **27 auto-discovered entities** in Home Assistant via MQTT Discovery protocol
  - **11 sensors**: Battery level, brightness, WiFi SSID, WiFi signal, light sensor, IP address, app version, memory used, storage free, current URL, volume
  - **6 binary sensors**: Screen on/off, screensaver active, battery charging, kiosk mode, device owner, motion detected
  - **2 number controls**: Brightness (0-100%), volume (0-100%) — adjustable sliders in HA
  - **2 switches**: Screen power (ON/OFF), screensaver (ON/OFF)
  - **5 buttons**: Reload, wake, reboot, clear cache, lock
  - **1 text entity**: Navigate URL — send a URL to load in the WebView
  - **20 additional commands** via MQTT: TTS, toast, audio play/stop/beep, launch app, execute JS, URL rotation start/stop, restart UI
  - **Push-based status**: Periodic state publishing (configurable 5-3600 seconds, default 30s)
  - **LWT (Last Will & Testament)**: Automatic availability tracking — HA shows device as unavailable on disconnect
  - **Auto-reconnect**: Handles WiFi drops and broker restarts with automatic re-publishing of all discovery configs
  - **Always-on Motion Detection**: Configurable option to run camera-based motion detection continuously (not just during screensaver)
  - **Full command parity** with REST API — both interfaces dispatch through the same command handler
  - **Concurrent operation**: MQTT and REST API can run simultaneously
  - Eclipse Paho MQTT v3.1.1 with secure password storage (Android Keychain)
  - Settings: Broker URL, port, username, password, client ID, base topic, discovery prefix, status interval, allow control
  - Connection status indicator in Settings UI
  - MQTT settings included in backup/restore
  - **[Full MQTT Documentation](docs/mqtt.md)**

- 🔊 **No audio in Lock Mode on Samsung/OneUI devices**: audio streams were muted by Samsung when `LOCK_TASK_FEATURE_NONE` was set, which is more restrictive than Android's own default behavior
  - `LOCK_TASK_FEATURE_GLOBAL_ACTIONS` is now included by default (matches Android's own default when `setLockTaskFeatures()` is never called), preventing Samsung/OneUI from muting audio in `LOCK_TASK_MODE_LOCKED`
  - Added `AudioManager` safety net: after entering lock task mode, `setMasterVolumeMuted(false)` is called followed by `ADJUST_UNMUTE` on all audio streams (MUSIC, NOTIFICATION, ALARM, RING)
  - **Settings UI change**: "Allow Power Menu" toggle renamed to "🔌 Block Power Menu" with inverted logic — power menu is now **allowed by default**, admin can explicitly block it if needed
  - **No migration required**: same storage key `@kiosk_allow_power_button` — existing user settings preserved; only new installs benefit from the new default
  - Applied consistently across `KioskModule.kt`, `MainActivity.kt`, and `AppLauncherModule.kt`
- 🔧 **Camera/Microphone not working in WebView on Fire OS** (Echo Show, Fire tablets) (#63): auto-grant WebView media/geolocation permissions in kiosk mode — OS-level permission via `pm grant` still required


***

## [1.2.12] - 2026-02-18

### Added
- 🔒 **Screen lock without Device Owner**: `screen/off` and `lock` now work with Device Admin or AccessibilityService
  - 4-tier fallback: Device Owner `lockNow()` → **Device Admin `lockNow()`** → AccessibilityService `GLOBAL_ACTION_LOCK_SCREEN` (API 28+) → dim brightness to 0
  - `dpm.lockNow()` is available to Device Admin apps (API 8+), not just Device Owner — was an oversight
  - Enables full FreeKiosk screen control when another MDM already holds Device Owner
  - Truly turns off the screen (hardware off) with any of the 3 first tiers
  - Wake-up cycle (`screen/on`, AlarmManager, WakeLock) unchanged and fully compatible
  - `/api/lock` and `screen/off` response now includes `"method"` field (`"DeviceOwner"`, `"DeviceAdmin"`, or `"AccessibilityService"`)

- **Inline PDF Viewer**: PDFs now open directly in-app via a bundled PDF.js viewer instead of being downloaded
  - Enabled via a toggle in **Settings → General → PDF Viewer**
  - Uses **PDF.js v3.11.174** bundled locally in Android assets — no Google Docs, no external service
  - Full viewer UI: page navigation (◀/▶), zoom (−/⊡/+), close (✕), and download (⬇) buttons
  - **Download button** triggers the native Android `DownloadManager` (notification + Downloads folder)
  - Intercepts PDF links at 3 levels:
    1. **JS injection**: strips `<a download>` attributes so Android's DownloadListener doesn't fire early
    2. **`onShouldStartLoadWithRequest`**: redirects `.pdf` URLs and Google redirect URLs (`google.com/url?url=...`) to the viewer
    3. **Native `DownloadListener` patch** (`RNCWebViewManagerImpl.kt`): intercepts PDFs detected by `Content-Type: application/pdf` or `Content-Disposition: attachment` and loads the viewer instead of downloading
  - **Native HTTP proxy** (`RNCWebViewClient.java` `shouldInterceptRequest`): when the viewer is active, proxies all remote PDF XHR requests via `HttpURLConnection` to bypass CORS restrictions — cookies and `Range` headers forwarded
  - Security: `allowFileAccess` / `allowUniversalAccessFromFileURLs` only enabled when PDF viewer is on
  - All patches saved in `patches/react-native-webview+13.16.0.patch` via `patch-package`

- ♿ **AccessibilityService for cross-app key injection**: New `FreeKioskAccessibilityService` enables keyboard emulation in External App mode
  - Uses `performGlobalAction()` for Back/Home/Recents/PlayPause navigation (all Android versions)
  - Uses `InputMethod.sendKeyEvent()` / `commitText()` for keys and text on Android 13+ (API 33+)
  - **DPAD navigation fallback** (all Android versions): spatial focus traversal via accessibility tree,
    `ACTION_CLICK` for select, `ACTION_SCROLL_FORWARD/BACKWARD` for scrolling
  - **Play/Pause** mapped to `GLOBAL_ACTION_KEYCODE_HEADSETHOOK` (Android 12+)
  - Fallback for Android 5–12: `ACTION_SET_TEXT` injects printable characters, text, Backspace, and Shift+letter
  - `KeyCharacterMap` converts keyCodes to printable characters for the ACTION_SET_TEXT fallback
  - 5-tier fallback chain: globalAction → InputMethod → a11y navigation → ACTION_SET_TEXT → `input keyevent`
  - **Settings UI**: New "Accessibility Service" section in Advanced Settings with:
    - Status indicator (Active / Enabled / Disabled)
    - "Open Accessibility Settings" button to launch Android's settings
    - "Enable Automatically" button for Device Owner mode (no user interaction needed)
    - Info box explaining why the service is needed
  - Compatible with privacy ROMs (e/OS, LineageOS, CalyxOS, GrapheneOS) where `Instrumentation` is blocked

### Fixed
- 🔊 **Volume buttons trigger PIN request when held** (#110): Holding the volume button to adjust volume would trigger the PIN request because both `MainActivity.onKeyDown` and `VolumeChangeReceiver` counted auto-repeat/rapid events as separate taps. Fixed by ignoring `KeyEvent` with `repeatCount > 0` in `MainActivity`, and adding a minimum 250ms interval between counted volume changes in `VolumeChangeReceiver` to filter out the rapid events (~50-100ms) generated by holding the button. Deliberate separate presses (>=250ms apart) still work normally. Reported by @Mkdir1511

- 🔑 **Key injection compatibility fix**: Replaced `Instrumentation.sendKeyDownUpSync()` with `activity.dispatchKeyEvent()` across all remote/keyboard endpoints
  - `Instrumentation` requires `INJECT_EVENTS` (signature-level permission) which privacy-focused ROMs (e/OS, LineageOS, CalyxOS, GrapheneOS) block
  - `dispatchKeyEvent()` dispatches directly into the Activity's View hierarchy — no special permission needed
  - Affects: `/api/remote/*` (all 9 keys), `/api/remote/keyboard/{key}`, `/api/remote/keyboard?map=...`, `/api/remote/text`
  - Also fixed in `KioskModule.sendRemoteKey()` (used by JS-side remote control)
  - No regression on standard ROMs (Samsung, Pixel, AOSP)

## [1.2.11] - 2026-02-16

### Added
- ⌨️ **Keyboard Emulation API**: Full keyboard input simulation via REST API ([#keyboard](https://github.com/FreeKiosk/FreeKiosk/issues))
  - **Single key press** (`GET|POST /api/remote/keyboard/{key}`): Send any keyboard key
    - Supports: a-z, 0-9, F1-F12, space, tab, enter, escape, backspace, delete, arrows, symbols, media keys
    - Over 80 named keys + single character support

  - **Text input** (`POST /api/remote/text`): Type full text strings into focused input fields
    - Body: `{"text": "Hello World!"}`
    - Uses `Instrumentation.sendStringSync()` for natural text input
  - All keyboard operations handled natively (no JS bridge — fast and reliable)
- 📍 **GPS Location API** (`GET /api/location`): New endpoint for device GPS coordinates
  - Returns: latitude, longitude, accuracy, altitude, speed, bearing, provider, timestamp
  - Uses GPS, Network, and Passive location providers (best accuracy wins)
  - Permissions already declared in manifest (`ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION` + `ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION`)
- 🔋 **Enriched Battery API**: `GET /api/battery` now returns additional data
  - New fields: `temperature` (°C), `voltage` (V), `health` (good/overheat/dead/etc.), `technology` (Li-ion/etc.)
  - Backward compatible: existing `level`, `charging`, `plugged` fields unchanged
- 🔒 **Lock Device API** (`GET|POST /api/lock`): New endpoint to lock the device screen
  - Uses `DevicePolicyManager.lockNow()` for a true screen lock (Device Owner required)
  - Returns clear error message if Device Owner mode is not active
- 🔄 **Restart UI API** (`GET|POST /api/restart-ui`): New endpoint to restart the app UI
  - Calls `activity.recreate()` to fully restart the React Native activity
  - Useful for remote troubleshooting without rebooting the device

- 🐛 **Screen Sleep Scheduler - Black Screen & Navigation Lockout**: Fixed 4 critical bugs causing scheduler to malfunction
  - **Feedback loop**: Scheduler re-entered sleep immediately after wake due to `isScheduledSleep` in useEffect dependency array
  - **Navigation lockout**: Scheduler interval kept running while on PIN/Settings screen, calling `lockNow()` and locking user out
  - **Wake-on-touch broken**: Touch events during sleep did nothing — never restored brightness or called `exitScheduledSleep()`
  - **Stale closure**: `checkScreenSchedule()` used outdated state variable instead of ref
  - **N-tap during sleep**: 5-tap for settings now properly exits scheduled sleep before navigating to PIN
  - **Activity null after lockNow()**: `turnScreenOn()` now acquires WakeLock before checking for activity availability
  - Fixes black screen issue on Android 8.1+ and impossible settings access during sleep windows
- 🐛 **Power menu dismissed immediately on some devices (TECNO/HiOS)**: Fixed GlobalActions (power menu) being closed ~900ms after appearing when "Allow Power Button" is enabled in Lock Mode
  - Root cause: `onWindowFocusChanged` aggressively re-applied immersive mode, stealing focus back from the system power menu window
  - Additionally, `onResume` would re-trigger `startLockTask()` during the brief focus transition, compounding the issue
  - Fix: debounced `hideSystemUI()` by 600ms on focus regain, and deferred `startLockTask()` re-lock when power button is allowed and focus was recently lost
  - No security impact: Lock Task Mode remains fully active throughout — only the cosmetic immersive mode re-application is delayed
  - Affects TECNO, Infinix, itel (HiOS) and potentially other OEMs with aggressive WindowManager behavior on Android 14+
- 🐛 **Device Owner Status Hardcoded `false` in API**: Fixed `/api/info` and `/api/status` always reporting `isDeviceOwner: false`
  - Was hardcoded to `false` in `HttpServerModule.getDeviceStatus()`
  - Now performs a real `DevicePolicyManager.isDeviceOwnerApp()` check
  - This caused external dashboards to incorrectly show Device Owner as inactive
- 📺 **Screen On Not Working After lockNow()**: Fixed `GET /api/screen/on` failing when screen was off
  - `reactContext.currentActivity` was `null` after `lockNow()` and the code silently did nothing
  - WakeLock is now acquired **before** checking for activity (WakeLock works without activity)
  - Added keyguard dismissal to properly wake from locked state
  - Screen now reliably turns on whether activity is available or not
- 🧹 **Clear Cache Now Actually Clears**: Fixed `/api/clearCache` which only reloaded the WebView
  - Now performs a full native cache clear: WebView HTTP cache, cookies, Web Storage (localStorage/sessionStorage), form data
  - Then forces a WebView remount on the JS side for a complete fresh start
- 🔄 **In-App Update 404 Error**: Fixed update download failing with 404 error
  - Now retrieves actual APK download URL from GitHub release assets instead of constructing it
  - Eliminates filename case sensitivity issues (FreeKiosk vs freeKiosk)
  - More robust: works regardless of APK naming convention changes
  - Fallback to constructed URL if asset parsing fails
- 📸 **Screenshot Race Condition**: Fixed `/api/screenshot` returning 503 intermittently
  - Replaced `Thread.sleep(100)` with a proper `CountDownLatch` to wait for the UI thread
  - Screenshot capture now waits up to 5 seconds for the UI thread to complete

***

## [1.2.10] - 2026-02-11

### Added
- ⏱️ **Inactivity Return - Scroll to Top Toggle**: New optional behavior for when already on start page
  - Added "Scroll to Top on Start Page" toggle (enabled by default)
  - When enabled and already on start page, smoothly scrolls to top instead of doing nothing
- 🔗 **URL Filtering (Blacklist / Whitelist)**: Control which URLs users can navigate to within the kiosk WebView
  - Choose between **Blacklist** mode (block specific URLs) or **Whitelist** mode (allow only specific URLs)
  - Wildcard pattern support (e.g., `*.example.com/*`, `freekiosk.app/download`)
  - Patterns without protocol are automatically matched with `http://` and `https://`
  - Main kiosk URL is always protected and cannot be blocked
  - Empty whitelist = strictest mode (only main URL allowed)
  - Works with both traditional navigation and SPA/client-side routing (pushState)
  - Optional visual feedback toast when a URL is blocked
  - Popup/new window URLs are also filtered

- 🔗 **URL Filtering - Form Submits and JS Buttons**: Fixed form submissions and JavaScript buttons being blocked in whitelist mode
  - Filter now compares origin + pathname instead of just origin
  - Same-page navigations (query params, hash changes, form submits) are always allowed
  - Trailing slashes are normalized (e.g., `https://example.com` and `https://example.com/` are treated as identical)
  - Only navigation to different pages on the same domain requires whitelist match
- 📡 **NFC Monitoring Fix**: Fixed "flicking back to blue screen" when NFC is enabled in kiosk mode
  - Foreground monitoring detected transient `com.android.nfc` package as a wrong app and triggered a relaunch loop
  - NFC system package is now filtered from monitoring checks only when NFC mode is active
  - No impact on monitoring behavior when NFC is disabled
- 💾 **Backup/Restore Missing Settings**: Fixed 20 settings keys not being included in export/import backups
  - Added missing URL filtering settings (blacklist/whitelist lists and configuration)
  - Added missing screen scheduler, inactivity return, blocking overlays settings
  - Added missing WebView back button, camera position, return-to-settings preferences
  - PIN mode setting now properly backed up and restored

  - OverlayService now recreates the status bar overlay after configuration changes
  - MainActivity re-hides Android system bars on rotation to prevent them from reappearing
- 🔧 **Lock Mode "Device Owner not configured" False Warning**: Fixed JS bundle out of sync with native Kotlin module
  - `startLockTask` call in bundled JS had 2 parameters instead of 3 (missing `allowNotifications`)
  - React Native bridge could not match the method signature, causing a silent exception
  - Resulted in false "Device Owner not configured" warning even when Device Owner was properly set
- 🖱️ **5-Tap During Page Load**: Fixed 5-tap not working while WebView is loading or when page fails to load
  - Invisible touch zone in bottom-right corner during loading and error states
  - Tapping it counts as a 5-tap interaction, allowing access to settings even without network
  - Touch zone disappears automatically once the page loads successfully (JS-based detection takes over)

### Fixed
- 🔊 **Volume buttons trigger PIN request when held** (#110): Holding the volume button to adjust volume would trigger the PIN request because both `MainActivity.onKeyDown` and `VolumeChangeReceiver` counted auto-repeat/rapid events as separate taps. Fixed by ignoring `KeyEvent` with `repeatCount > 0` in `MainActivity`, and adding a minimum 250ms interval between counted volume changes in `VolumeChangeReceiver` to filter out the rapid events (~50-100ms) generated by holding the button. Deliberate separate presses (>=250ms apart) still work normally. Reported by @Mkdir1511
